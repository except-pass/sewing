# Sewing Discord
> Gathers discord threads and makes them available as a digest


## Quick Start

Go to a discord channel that is running this bot and type `!how` for instructions


## Add this bot to your server

Use this link:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=873958608956710912&permissions=67584&scope=bot

The bot needs `Send Messages` and `Read Message History` permissions.  

## Still to do

A ton of stuff!  

- First, we probably want nicer design than just plaintext.  Also there is no indication of messages that are replying to other messages.  If I could just lift the default discord design wholesale I would.

- Links from the email to the messages right in discord.  Could not find documentation on how to do this.

- Cosmetic stuff like an image for the bot.

- Next I will look for hosting and a domain for the emails to come from.  

- After that, lots of backend improvements.  I hacked together the data model before I really understood what I wanted so I'd like to revisit that.
